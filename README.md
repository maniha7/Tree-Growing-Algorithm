# Tree-Growing-Algorithm

This project comprises a set of several algorithms which together draw a randomly generated tree on the users screen, before infinitely cycling through the 4 seasons. Separate algorithms control branch generation, leaf generation, and each of the respective seasons. Each time the simulation is reset with the r key, a differently shaped tree is grown. Seasonal aspects including leaf growth/fall patterns and snowfall are also randomly generated, but are less visually apparent.
